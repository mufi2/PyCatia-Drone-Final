# **Initialization**

## **Initialization of CATIA Part Document**

The `initialize_catia_part` function is central to setting up a structured environment for automating tasks in CATIA using Python. This function ensures a clean, controlled workspace by creating a new CATIA Part document, free from any interference caused by previously opened documents. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step explanation of its functionality:

### 1. **Close Any Open Documents**
The function begins by accessing the active CATIA application instance and checking for any open documents. If found, these documents are closed to ensure a clean workspace, avoiding potential conflicts from previously opened files.

### 2. **Create a New Part Document**
The command `documents.add("Part")` initializes a new, blank part document in CATIA. This document serves as the foundation where geometrical and structural components can be defined and manipulated.

### 3. **Retrieve Essential References**
Key references needed for CAD operations are collected to simplify subsequent processes. These include:
   - **`application`**: The reference to the CATIA application.
   - **`document`**: The active document in which the part is created.
   - **`part`**: Represents the part object where design elements are introduced.
   - **`partbody`**: The main body of the part, serving as the workspace for solid geometry creation.
   - **`sketches`**: A collection of sketches contained within the part body.
   - **`hybrid_bodies`**: Hybrid bodies for handling complex, non-standard shapes.
   - **`hsf` and `shpfac`**: Hybrid Shape Factory and Shape Factory for generating 3D shapes and features.
   - **`selection`**: Tool used for selecting objects within the document.
   - **`plane_XY`, `plane_YZ`, `plane_ZX`**: The three main reference planes used for sketching and positioning geometries in 3D space.

### 4. **Set the Active Work Object**
The function sets the `PartBody` as the active work object using `part.in_work_object = partbody`. This ensures that any actions, such as creating sketches or applying features, will be executed within the main part body, maintaining a structured and organized design process.

### 5. **Return References**
The function concludes by returning a dictionary containing all the essential references, making them easily accessible for future operations and ensuring that subsequent tasks can be performed without needing to retrieve each reference individually.

### **Purpose of Initialization**

# **Front-End Development** üöÄ

The **Front-End** of this project delivers an interface, enabling users to input key parameters to automate the Cyborg Surveillance Drone design. Developed using **Tkinter**, it focuses on efficiency and user experience, allowing for seamless interaction.

### **Layout and Structure** üìê

The interface is divided into an input section on the left and an image display on the right. The **Tkinter window** (`root`) is sized at 800x400, offering a clean and functional layout. The main inputs include `Length (L)`, `Width (R)`, and `Cut-off (X)`, entered via **Entry** widgets, with labels providing instructions.

A **Generate Drone** button triggers the **generate_drone()** function, which processes and validates inputs, ensuring proper ranges for `L` (30-285), `R` (30-285), and `X` (20-30).

### **Image Handling** üñºÔ∏è

The **load_custom_image()** function manages the display of dynamic images. Using **Pillow**, the images are resized to fit the display frame while maintaining quality through the **LANCZOS** algorithm. This function ensures real-time feedback, enhancing the interactivity of the GUI.

### **Progress and Status Updates** üìä

A **progress bar** visually tracks the generation process, while the **status label** informs users of key updates, like the completion of the drone generation.

### **Key Functions and Variables** ‚öôÔ∏è

- **`generate_drone()`**: Handles user inputs, converts them to integers, and validates their ranges. It updates the progress bar and manages the logic for generating the drone part.
- **L, R, X**: Global variables holding the length, width, and cut-off parameters.
- **output_list**: Stores the validated parameters for further processing.

# **Back-end (Design Implementation)**
## *Padding the Chastity and Applying Chamfers* üöÄ

### **Padding the Chastity** üõ†Ô∏è

This process creates a custom 3D pad from a sketch on the XY plane, driven by parameters that define the shape and size, followed by extrusion into a 3D part.

#### Key Variables:
- **`L` (Length)**: Horizontal dimension.
- **`R` (Width)**: Vertical dimension.
- **`X` (Offset)**: Adjusts specific points.
- **`H` (Height)**: Extrusion distance.

#### Process Overview:
1. **Sketch Creation**: The sketch is created on the XY plane, with points like `p1 = (L, R - X)` defining the shape‚Äôs boundaries.
2. **Closed Loop**: Lines are drawn between points, forming a closed-loop using CATIA‚Äôs 2D tools.
3. **Extrusion**: The sketch is extruded into a 3D pad with height `H` using **`shpfac.add_new_pad()`** and regular orientation. The part is updated with **`document.part.update()`**.

### **Edges and Chamfer Application** ‚ú®

Chamfers are applied to smooth edges, improving the design‚Äôs aesthetics and function.

#### Key Variables:
- **`G` (Chamfer Length)**: Chamfer length.
- **`Chamfer Angle`**: Chamfer angle (default 30¬∞).
- **`Selection Tool`**: Used to select edges for chamfering.

#### Process Overview:
1. **Edge Selection**: The user selects 16 edges, which are stored in `edge_references`.
2. **Chamfer Initialization**: The chamfer is applied to the first edge using **`shpfac.add_new_chamfer()`**, based on the set length, angle, and tangential propagation.
3. **Remaining Edges**: Additional edges are chamfered in sequence for uniformity.
4. **Finalizing**: The document is updated to integrate the chamfered edges using **`document.part.update()`**.

## *Rotor Pad Operations* üõ†Ô∏è

### **Cleaning and Preparing Surface References**

This process begins by cleaning the surface reference from JSON format to define the sketch planes for geometry operations. The **`remove_selection_rsur_section()`** function removes unnecessary prefixes like `Selection_RSur`, making the surface name usable in CATIA.

#### Key Variables:
- **`input_string`**: Raw surface reference from JSON.
- **`cleaned_string`**: Processed surface name ready for CATIA.

Once cleaned, **`part.create_reference_from_name()`** creates the surface reference for the sketch. This forms the foundation for further geometry.

#### Process Overview:
1. **Surface Cleanup**: The surface reference is cleaned for CATIA operations.
2. **Sketch Creation**: A new sketch, `"box"`, is created on the cleaned surface, defined by points like `p1`, `p2`, etc.
3. **Extruding the Sketch**: The sketch is extruded into a 3D pad with **`shpfac.add_new_pad()`**, ensuring correct orientation via **`catRegularOrientation`**.


### **Chamfering Edges Based on Selection**

After creating the pad, chamfers are applied to smooth the edges for a refined finish.

#### Key Variables:
- **`edge_names`**: JSON-stored edge references.
- **`chamfer_length`** and **`chamfer_angle`**: Length and angle of the chamfer.

#### Process Overview:
1. **Cleaning Edge References**: **`remove_selection_section()`** strips `Selection_REdge`, making the edges suitable for CATIA.
2. **Chamfer Application**: The first edge is chamfered with **`shpfac.add_new_chamfer()`**, using predefined chamfer length and angle.
3. **Chamfer Propagation**: Additional edges are added to the chamfer operation for uniformity.
4. **Finalizing**: The chamfer is rendered with **`document.part.update()`**.


### **Pocket Creation on Defined Surfaces**

This step creates a pocket on a defined surface, allowing for material removal.

#### Key Variables:
- **`pocket_depth`**: Depth of the pocket.
- **`offset_x`**, **`offset_y`**: Adjustments to pocket placement.

#### Process Overview:
1. **Surface Reference Cleanup**: Cleans the surface for pocket sketching.
2. **Sketching the Pocket**: A rectangle is sketched using points, with offsets applied for accurate placement.
3. **Pocket Creation**: The sketch is extruded into a pocket with **`shpfac.add_new_pocket()`**, using the defined depth and **`catInverseOrientation`**.
4. **Finalizing**: The pocket is integrated with **`document.part.update()`**.
